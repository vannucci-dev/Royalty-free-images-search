### Search engine for Royalty free Images

## Version 1.2
In this version the images are showed using CSS grid and the span required by each image is determined by the height of the image itself, using React-Ref and state.


## Version 1.0

In this version the API request is only made to Unsplash API and the list is rendered in a simple list.

I've used this app to learn about API requests using AXIOS and async/await functions in ReactJS.
